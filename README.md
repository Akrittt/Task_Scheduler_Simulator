## 🧠 Overview

This project is a **Java-based CPU Task Scheduler Simulator** that implements classical operating system scheduling algorithms such as:

- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- SRJF (Shortest Job First) or SJF(PREEMPTIVE)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin 

It calculates and displays:
- Completion Time
- Turnaround Time
- Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround/Waiting Time
- Gantt Chart (text-based)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java 8+**
- **OOP Principles**
- Java Collections (ArrayList, Comparator)

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Simulates CPU scheduling for multiple processes  
✅ Supports all major scheduling algorithms  
✅ Clean and modular OOP structure  
✅ Text-based Gantt Chart visualization  
✅ Well-commented and beginner-friendly code
